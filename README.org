#+author: Lens
#+description: A parser for the language FUNCompiler compiles based on tree sitter.
#+created: <2022-12-03 Sat>

** Dependencies

- A C compiler (we like [[https://gcc.gnu.org/][GCC]])
- [[https://nodejs.org/en/][Node.js]] (sorry)

** How to Build

#+begin_src sh
  npm install
  npx tree-sitter generate
  cmake -B bld
  cmake --build bld
#+end_src

This will compile and link a shared library ~tree-sitter-un~ into the
=bld= subdirectory. It is recommended to copied into =~/.tree_sitter/bin=.
This shared library could also be add the =bld= path into ~parser-directories~
in =~/tree-sitter/config.json=.
